## Installation

For now, clone this directory and do an editable install:

```batch
    $ pip install -e . 
```

In the future we would like to be able to do: 

```batch

    $ pip install eh22tools
```

This is the preferred method to install eh22tools, as it will always
install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this
[Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.
